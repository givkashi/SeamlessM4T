SeamlessM4T is designed to provide high quality translation, allowing people from different linguistic communities to communicate effortlessly through speech and text.

SeamlessM4T covers:
- üì• 101 languages for speech input.
- ‚å®Ô∏è 96 Languages for text input/output.
- üó£Ô∏è 35 languages for speech output.

This unified model enables multiple tasks without relying on multiple separate models:
- Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST)
- Speech-to-text translation (S2TT)
- Text-to-speech translation (T2ST)
- Text-to-text translation (T2TT)
- Automatic speech recognition (ASR)
